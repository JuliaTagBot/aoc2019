# Advent of Code 2019 in Julia

This is a repository of my solutions to the [AoC 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) contest.

The code for day 1 assumes that the input is stored in the file `input1.txt`, and so on.

(For maximum fun, try writing you own solutions before looking at somebody else's.)
